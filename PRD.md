Product Requirements Document

"The Why"; Product requirements, benchmark metadata table, high-level requirements, etc. Defines the benchmark goal, validation objective, test name, benchmark number, category, and high-level success criteria.

## Benchmark Matrix Document Metadata (via benchmark_specification.json)

This PRD.md section is populated from benchmark_specification.json, which is the structured source of benchmark-specific product requirements.

## Workload Number
212

## Workload Name
lmbench Microbench Suite

## Execution Summary (Run and Measure)
Run lmbench lat_syscall (null and read), lat_ctx, lat_mem_rd 16 128, bw_mem 512m rd, and bw_pipe once per yaml repetitions, then parse the first float, to measure syscall, context-switch, and memory-read latency plus memory and pipe bandwidth. lat_pipe, lat_unix, and lat_proc are not executed

## Main Goal
Measure a fixed lmbench microbench subset

## Validation Objective
Validates that the five executed binaries return finite values. write/stat/open syscalls and lat_pipe/lat_unix/lat_proc are not collected

## Workload Category
System Profiling & Performance Analysis

## Validation Requirement

The benchmark must include an automated SQLite-integrated validation layer that verifies persisted results from `results/benchmark.db`. Validation must confirm:

1. The benchmark run completed successfully with no tool errors.
2. Required samples and aggregate metrics were persisted for every swept shape.
3. Metrics are finite and physically sensible (positive, within plausible bounds).
4. Measured values satisfy configured thresholds when the workload defines pass/fail gates.
5. The benchmark fails validation when required data is missing, invalid, or outside bounds.

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement | Target |
|---|---|
| Automation | Runs to completion without manual intervention after `bash run_benchmark.sh` |
| Idempotency | Re-running `run_benchmark.sh` appends a new run; never corrupts existing rows |
| Persistence | All metrics survive script exit; `results/benchmark.db` is the durable record |
